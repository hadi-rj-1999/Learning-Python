# Python Control Flow - Learning Materials

This directory covers Python control flow statements for program logic and decision making.

## 📁 Files Overview

### [if_else.py](if_else.py)
- Basic `if` statements
- `if-else` constructs
- `if-elif-else` chains
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Nested if statements
- Ternary operator (conditional expressions)
- Membership testing with `in` and `not in`

### [loops_for.py](loops_for.py)
- `for` loops with different iterables:
  - Lists, tuples, strings
  - Dictionaries (keys, values, items)
  - Sets and ranges
- `range()` function with different parameters
- `break` and `continue` statements
- `else` clause in for loops
- Nested for loops
- `enumerate()` for index-value pairs
- `zip()` for multiple sequences
- List comprehensions

### [loops_while.py](loops_while.py)
- Basic `while` loops
- `while` loops with user input
- `break` and `continue` in while loops
- `else` clause in while loops
- Nested while loops
- Practical examples:
  - Number guessing game
  - Fibonacci sequence
  - Factorial calculation
  - Password validation
  - Menu systems

### [break_continue.py](break_continue.py)
- Detailed usage of `break` statement
- Detailed usage of `continue` statement
- Break/continue in both for and while loops
- Break/continue in nested loops
- Practical patterns:
  - Early exit for efficiency
  - Skip expensive operations
  - Input validation loops
- Interaction with loop `else` clauses

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Make decisions with conditional statements
- Iterate over sequences with loops
- Control loop execution with break/continue
- Handle different looping scenarios
- Write efficient and readable control flow

## 💡 Tips
- Use `elif` for multiple conditions instead of nested if
- Prefer for loops when you know iterations in advance
- Use while loops for unknown iterations
- Be careful with infinite while loops
- Use `enumerate()` when you need indices
- List comprehensions are more Pythonic for simple transformations
